Cordova-for-spacebro

A simple program displaying the Bonjour/Zeroconf service using cordova-plugin-zeroconf : https://github.com/becvert/cordova-plugin-zeroconf

on Android and ios.

Troubleshooting :

The command phonegap serve [options] does not work as it is not equivalent as installing the app on the device. It creates a server to host and thus uses the browser version of phonegap. It
will result in the plugins being undefined.

Use the command phonegap/cordova [run/install] [platform]
